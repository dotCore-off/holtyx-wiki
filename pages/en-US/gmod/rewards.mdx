# ðŸª™ Rewards system

## Rewards
While playing on our servers, you will be **granted coins, gems or even items as rewards**.  
**The following events will give you coins for example:**
- **killing another player** (10 coins)
- **killing hunter player during Bounty round** (25.000 coins)
- **winning a round** (25 coins as a Victim, 250 as a Killer)
- **playing a taunt** (taunt duration in seconds)
- *and many more...*

These are the **default rewards**, but we decided to **scale them** based on bellow factors.

## Multipliers
For each given reward, **a multiplier is added** based on following scenarios.

### For playercount
- Total players **< 10** = ``x0.5``
- Total players **< 15** = ``x0.75``
- Total players **< 20** = ``x1``
- Total players **>= 25** = ``x2``

### For VIP ranks
- **Gold** player = ``x1.25``
- **Adamant** player = ``x2``
- **Aether** player = ``x3``

### For special rounds
- If a **victim survives during Infected** = ``x2``
- If a **killer survives during Juggernaught** = ``x2``
- If **hunted player survives during Bounty** = ``x2``

### Calculation
After completing each of above verifications, a **final multiplier is given and applied to base reward**.  
**Here are some examples:**
- You are a **Aether** user (x3), there are **21 players online** (x1) and **no special round**, **the final multiplier will be x4** *- killing a player will give you 10 x 4 = 40 coins*
- You have **no VIP rank**, there are **7 players online** (x0.5) and **no special round**, **the final multiplier will be x0.5** *- killing a player will give you 10 x 0.5 = 5 coins*
