# 📆 Battle Pass
The Battle Pass is a **task based system** that attributes you **one task per tier**. On task completion, you will be **able to claim tier rewards** and move on to the next task.  
Each Battle Pass and its associated rewards usually **lasts a few weeks**.

## What is it?
It is a free extra feature that can be accessed through a dedicated UI, and it offers various tasks to complete and earn limited rewards. No more losing interest or being bored while playing, you will always have something to achieve.  

You can access this feature in our **F4 Menu** *(- Battle Pass tab)* or by entering **/bp** command in chat.

## How does it work?
On each new season, a Battle Pass with a bunch of cool rewards & tiers is created.  
You will be **assigned a task** *(same for everyone)* per tier, and upon completion, **level up your tier** and be able to **claim associated rewards**.  

**There is one task assigned per tier, here are a few examples:**
- Kill 20 players
- Win 3 rounds
- Taunt 50 times

Usually, **task difficulty increases over tiers**, and rewards rarity too!  
Rewards can be **claimed at any time** after being unlocked.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If Battle Pass ends and you didn't claim all rewards, **they will be lost forever**, so make sure to claim them regularly!
</Callout>

There is a **Premium version** that **reduces task goals** and contains access to **Premium only rewards**.  
It is available through **in-game purchase with Gems** *(price fluctuates based on Battle Pass length and rewards)* or through [our Tebex store](https://shop.holtyx.com).
