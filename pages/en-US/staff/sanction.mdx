## Guidelines
### Double Penalty Rule
If a player **repeats an offense twice in a row** *(both in voice and text chats)*, double the penalty.
> *Example: someone spam in voice (= 5m) then they spam in text, sanction is 15m + warn (0 point)*

If a player **repeats a recently sanctioned behavior**, double the penalty.
> *Example: a player says nword (= 5m) then someone else says it, sanction is 30m + warn (1 point) for racism*

### A few tips
- you **can't spam warn** someone because you don't like them or for no reason
- if you ever **question a warn** by another Staff member, **contact an Administrator**
- if you are **trial** or want to **make a custom warn **but can't, **contact an Administrator**
- if you **ban someone** due to text / voice related problems, **report it to an Administrator**
- **do not argue with players** regarding a sanction in game chats
- **do not ruin the fun for players**, it's common sense, sometimes there's need to be chill with players and not strictly follow these rule books

    **Friendly reminder for Staff members**  
    We are in this team **not because it's a job or we wanna get rid off other players**, but because **we value player's fun and safety over anything else**.  

    Our goal **isn't to penalize** every little mic burp or player screams, but **share a good time with them** while ensuring there's no chaos in the servers.
